# The Vessel Database
This is a SQLite3 database of container ships and their lashing gear. It is free to use and updated roughly weekly. I have a script that runs weekly to update the vessel name based on its IMO code. Most of this data started with Rey from ILWU Local 13 and is now maintained by Blake from ILWU Local 514.

## Terminology
I have tried to use the [MacGregor product catalogue](https://www.macgregor.com/globalassets/picturepark/imported-assets/65120.pdf) terms or the terms the crew use for field names. Here is a quick reference:

- "External" lashing is "Knuckle" or "Chinese".
- "Horizontal" lashing is "Belly" or "Barrel" or "Torpedoes".
- "Twistlocks" are the above deck "Cones" or "Stackers".
- "Midlocks" are "Bananas" or the cones between tight 20's on deck.
- "Guts" is the lashing between 20's on deck.
- "Lid Twistlocks" are "Deck Stackers" and are used to secure the containers to the lid.
- "Lashing Bridges" are "Catwalks" or "Walkways".
